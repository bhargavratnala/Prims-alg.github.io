GMR SCHOOL OF BUSINESS will attempt to influence organizations through its participants from various programs/activities, thus acquiring recognition as an influential member in Indian society in the field of management education.
                GMR SCHOOL OF BUSINESS will attempt to synthesize the apparent contradictions in western efficiency and eastern ethos, and in competition and collaboration. It will emphasize skills and attitudes as much as knowledge by developing indigenous learner centric pedagogic technologies and adapting practices.</p>
