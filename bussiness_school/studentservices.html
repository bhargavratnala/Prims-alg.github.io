    <h1 style="padding: 10px 60px; text-align: center; color: #22578F;">Student Housing</h1>
    <p style="margin: 10px 60px;">GMRSB has partnered with Banyan Tree Retreat (BTR) to make available to you some world-class residential facilities. Students from the last eight cohorts have resided in this facility and their overwhelmingly positive experience, has motivated the school to continue the relationship with BTR. The BTR community is located 16 KM’s south of the campus and it normally takes 20-25 minutes to commute. GMRSB has organized private bus transportation for each day of the academic year.</p>
    <h1 style="padding: 10px 60px; text-align: center; color: #22578F;">International Relations including immigration advising</h1>
    <p style="margin: 10px 60px;">The Schulich School of Business places a high value on integrating international experiences into business education. With an increasingly globalized world, we believe in preparing our students for their careers. Whether incoming or outgoing, we are committed to giving you the international educational experience of a lifetime. For more information, click here.
        We understand that each student has a unique immigration application because they come from so many different countries and backgrounds, and you may have numerous questions about your Visa application, study permits, travel limits, employment permits, and your status in Canada. To answer these queries we recommend you to connect with our International Relations team via Study Permit Drop-ins Sessions.</p>
